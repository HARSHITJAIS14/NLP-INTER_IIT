It is measured in volts (V) and is expressed as a sine wave. AC voltage is used in many applications, including power transmission and electronic devices. The voltage is typically measured using a voltmeter, which is a device that measures the voltage between two points in a circuit. The voltage can be measured in either the positive or negative direction, depending on the polarity of the circuit. The voltage can also be measured in terms of its amplitude, which is the maximum value of the voltage. The voltage can be measured in terms of its frequency, which is the number of cycles of the voltage per second. The voltage can also be measured in terms of its phase, which is the relationship between the voltage and the current in the circuit. The voltage can be measured in terms of its power, which is the amount of energy that is transferred by the voltage per unit time. The voltage can also be measured in terms of its resistance, which is the opposition to the flow of current in the circuit. The voltage can be measured in terms of its capacitance, which is the ability of the circuit to store electrical energy.
