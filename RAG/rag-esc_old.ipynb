This increase in current is due to an ionization process where minority carriers gain sufficient energy to release additional carriers through collisions with atomic structures, resulting in a high avalanche current.\n\nIn the context of a p-n junction, the avalanche region is the area where the voltage across the diode increases in the reverse-bias region, leading to a rapid increase in current. This region is characterized by a high velocity and associated kinetic energy of minority carriers, which can release additional carriers through collisions with atomic structures.\n\nAvalanche diodes are often used in applications where a high current is required in a short period, such as in power supplies, motor control, and switching circuits.
